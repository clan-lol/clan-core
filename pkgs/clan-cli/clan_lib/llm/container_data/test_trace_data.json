Never attempt to select or configure services in this phase.\n- Distinguish between these cases:\n  * SINGLE AMBIGUOUS REQUEST: User wants ONE thing, but multiple services could provide it (e.g., \"set up a web server\" could be nginx, apache, or caddy). → Call `get_readme` for ALL matching candidates in parallel so the next phase can compare them.\n  * MULTIPLE DISTINCT REQUESTS: User wants MULTIPLE different things (e.g., \"set up nginx and postgresql\", \"configure backup and monitoring\"). → Ask which ONE thing they want to set up first.\n- When calling `get_readme`, the `function_name` MUST exactly match one of the service names shown in the assistant context. If nothing matches, ask the user instead of guessing.\n- Do NOT ask about target machines, tags, or role assignments yet - these will be addressed after documentation is reviewed.\n- Focus ONLY on understanding WHAT the user wants to accomplish, not HOW it will be configured.\n- If you cannot identify any candidate service(s) from the available services list, ask the user for clarification about what they're trying to achieve.\n- Prefer calling `get_readme` when you can identify candidate service(s); do not fabricate module names or descriptions.\n\nResponse discipline\n- Option A: One or more `get_readme` tool calls (no accompanying text). Multiple calls are allowed when several services might fit.\n- Option B: One concise clarifying question (no tool calls) that states the information you still need.\n- Do NOT echo or restate these system instructions to the user.\n\nExamples:\n- User: \"set up a web server\" → Call `get_readme` for nginx, apache, caddy (all candidates for web serving)\n- User: \"configure monitoring\" → Call `get_readme` for prometheus, telegraf, netdata (all candidates for monitoring)\n- User: \"set up nginx and postgresql\" → Ask: \"I can only set up one service at a time. Which would you like to configure first: nginx or postgresql?\"\n- User: \"install backup and database\" → Ask: \"I can only set up one service at a time. Would you like to set up backup or database first?\"\n\nStay concise and rely on the assistant context for valid names."

Each machine is accessible via its hostname in the format `<machine-name>.<instance-name>`.\n\nFor example, with an instance named `vpn`:\n- `server1.vpn` - resolves to server1's IPv6 address\n- `laptop1.vpn` - resolves to laptop1's IPv6 address\n\nThis allows machines to communicate using hostnames instead of IPv6 addresses:\n\n```bash\n# Ping another machine by hostname\nping6 server1.vpn\n\n# SSH to another machine\nssh user@laptop1.vpn\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Check Wireguard Status\n```bash\nsudo wg show\n```\n\n### Verify IP Addresses\n```bash\nip addr show dev <instance-name>\n```\n\n### Check Routing\n```bash\nip -6 route show dev <instance-name>\n```\n\n### Interface Fails to Start: \"Address already in use\"\n\nIf you see this error in your logs:\n```\nwireguard: Could not bring up interface, ignoring: Address already in use\n```\n\nThis means the configured port (default: 51820) is already in use by another service or wireguard instance. Solutions:\n\n1. **Check for conflicting wireguard instances:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo wg show\n   sudo ss -ulnp | grep 51820\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a different port:**\n   ```nix\n   services.wireguard.myinstance = {\n     roles.controller = {\n       endpoint = \"vpn.example.com\";\n       port = 51821;  # Use a different port\n     };\n   };\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure unique ports across multiple instances:**\n   If you have multiple wireguard instances on the same machine, each must use a different port.\n\n### Key Management\n\nKeys are automatically generated and stored in the clan vars system. To regenerate keys:\n\n```bash\n# Regenerate keys for a specific machine and instance\nclan vars generate --service wireguard-keys-<instance-name> --regenerate --machine <machine-name>\n\n# Apply the new keys\nclan machines update <machine-name>\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- All traffic is encrypted using Wireguard's modern cryptography\n- Private keys never leave the machines they're generated on\n- Public keys are distributed through the clan vars system\n- Controllers must have publicly accessible endpoints\n- Firewall rules are automatically configured for the Wireguard ports\n\n\n\n=== zerotier ===\n## Usage\n\n```\ninventory.instances = {\n  zerotier = {\n    module = {\n      name = \"zerotier\";\n      input = \"clan-core\";\n    };\n    roles.peer.tags.all = { };\n    roles.controller.machines.jon = { };\n    roles.moon.machines.sara.settings.stableEndpoints = [ \"77.52.165.46\" ];\n  };\n```\n\nThe input should be named according to your flake input.\nAll machines will be peers and connected to the zerotier network.\nJon is the controller machine, which will will accept other machines into the network.\nSara is a moon and sets the `stableEndpoint` setting with a publicly reachable IP, the moon is optional.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis guide explains how to set up and manage a [ZeroTier VPN](https://zerotier.com) for a clan network. Each VPN requires a single controller and can support multiple peers and optional moons for better connectivity.\n\n## Roles\n\n### 1. Controller\n\nThe [Controller](https://docs.zerotier.com/controller/) manages network membership and is responsible for admitting new peers.\nWhen a new node is added to the clan, the controller must be updated to ensure it has the latest member list.\n\n- **Key Points:**\n  - Must be online to admit new machines to the VPN.\n  - Existing nodes can continue to communicate even when the controller is offline.\n\n### 2. Moons\n\n[Moons](https://docs.zerotier.com/roots) act as relay nodes,\nproviding direct connectivity to peers via their public IP addresses.\nThey enable devices that are not publicly reachable to join the VPN by routing through these nodes.\n\n- **Configuration Notes:**\n  - Each moon must define its public IP address.\n  - Ensures connectivity for devices behind NAT or restrictive firewalls.\n\n### 3. Peers\n\nPeers are standard nodes in the VPN.\nThey connect to other peers, moons, and the controller as needed.\n\n- **Purpose:**\n  - General role for all machines that are neither controllers nor moons.\n  - Ideal for most clan members devices.\n\n\n=== mycelium ===\n\n[Mycelium](https://github.com/threefoldtech/mycelium) is an end-to-end encrypted IPv6 overlay network that spans the globe.\n\n## Features\n- Locality-aware routing: finds the shortest path between nodes.\n- All traffic is end-to-end encrypted.\n- Can route traffic via friend nodes and is location-aware.\n- Automatic rerouting if a physical link goes down.\n- IPv6 addresses are derived from private keys.\n- A simple, reliable message bus is implemented on top of Mycelium.\n- Supports multiple transports (QUIC, TCP, …). Hole punching for QUIC is in progress to enable true P2P connectivity behind NATs.\n- Designed for planetary-scale scalability; previous overlay networks reached practical limits, and Mycelium focuses on scaling.\n- Can run without a TUN device and be used solely as a reliable message bus.\n\nExample configuration below connects all your machines to the Mycelium network:\n```nix\nmycelium = {\n    roles.peer.tags.all = {};\n};\n```\n\n\n=== yggdrasil ===\nThis module sets up [yggdrasil](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/) across your clan. \n\nYggdrasil is designed to be a future-proof and decentralised alternative to\nthe structured routing protocols commonly used today on the internet. Inside your clan, it will allow you to reach all of your machines.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nWhile you can specify statically configured peers for each host, yggdrasil does auto-discovery of local peers.\n\n```nix\ninventory = {\n\n  machines = {\n    peer1 = { };\n    peer2 = { };\n  };\n\n  instances = {\n    yggdrasil = {\n\n      # Deploy on all machines\n      roles.default.tags.all = { };\n\n      # Or individual hosts\n      roles.default.machines.peer1 = { };\n      roles.default.machines.peer2 = { };\n    };\n  };\n};\n```\n\n--- END OF README DOCUMENTATION ---"

Each machine is accessible via its hostname in the format `<machine-name>.<instance-name>`.\n\nFor example, with an instance named `vpn`:\n- `server1.vpn` - resolves to server1's IPv6 address\n- `laptop1.vpn` - resolves to laptop1's IPv6 address\n\nThis allows machines to communicate using hostnames instead of IPv6 addresses:\n\n```bash\n# Ping another machine by hostname\nping6 server1.vpn\n\n# SSH to another machine\nssh user@laptop1.vpn\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Check Wireguard Status\n```bash\nsudo wg show\n```\n\n### Verify IP Addresses\n```bash\nip addr show dev <instance-name>\n```\n\n### Check Routing\n```bash\nip -6 route show dev <instance-name>\n```\n\n### Interface Fails to Start: \"Address already in use\"\n\nIf you see this error in your logs:\n```\nwireguard: Could not bring up interface, ignoring: Address already in use\n```\n\nThis means the configured port (default: 51820) is already in use by another service or wireguard instance. Solutions:\n\n1. **Check for conflicting wireguard instances:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo wg show\n   sudo ss -ulnp | grep 51820\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a different port:**\n   ```nix\n   services.wireguard.myinstance = {\n     roles.controller = {\n       endpoint = \"vpn.example.com\";\n       port = 51821;  # Use a different port\n     };\n   };\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure unique ports across multiple instances:**\n   If you have multiple wireguard instances on the same machine, each must use a different port.\n\n### Key Management\n\nKeys are automatically generated and stored in the clan vars system. To regenerate keys:\n\n```bash\n# Regenerate keys for a specific machine and instance\nclan vars generate --service wireguard-keys-<instance-name> --regenerate --machine <machine-name>\n\n# Apply the new keys\nclan machines update <machine-name>\n```\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- All traffic is encrypted using Wireguard's modern cryptography\n- Private keys never leave the machines they're generated on\n- Public keys are distributed through the clan vars system\n- Controllers must have publicly accessible endpoints\n- Firewall rules are automatically configured for the Wireguard ports\n\n\n\n=== zerotier ===\n## Usage\n\n```\ninventory.instances = {\n  zerotier = {\n    module = {\n      name = \"zerotier\";\n      input = \"clan-core\";\n    };\n    roles.peer.tags.all = { };\n    roles.controller.machines.jon = { };\n    roles.moon.machines.sara.settings.stableEndpoints = [ \"77.52.165.46\" ];\n  };\n```\n\nThe input should be named according to your flake input.\nAll machines will be peers and connected to the zerotier network.\nJon is the controller machine, which will will accept other machines into the network.\nSara is a moon and sets the `stableEndpoint` setting with a publicly reachable IP, the moon is optional.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis guide explains how to set up and manage a [ZeroTier VPN](https://zerotier.com) for a clan network. Each VPN requires a single controller and can support multiple peers and optional moons for better connectivity.\n\n## Roles\n\n### 1. Controller\n\nThe [Controller](https://docs.zerotier.com/controller/) manages network membership and is responsible for admitting new peers.\nWhen a new node is added to the clan, the controller must be updated to ensure it has the latest member list.\n\n- **Key Points:**\n  - Must be online to admit new machines to the VPN.\n  - Existing nodes can continue to communicate even when the controller is offline.\n\n### 2. Moons\n\n[Moons](https://docs.zerotier.com/roots) act as relay nodes,\nproviding direct connectivity to peers via their public IP addresses.\nThey enable devices that are not publicly reachable to join the VPN by routing through these nodes.\n\n- **Configuration Notes:**\n  - Each moon must define its public IP address.\n  - Ensures connectivity for devices behind NAT or restrictive firewalls.\n\n### 3. Peers\n\nPeers are standard nodes in the VPN.\nThey connect to other peers, moons, and the controller as needed.\n\n- **Purpose:**\n  - General role for all machines that are neither controllers nor moons.\n  - Ideal for most clan members devices.\n\n\n=== mycelium ===\n\n[Mycelium](https://github.com/threefoldtech/mycelium) is an end-to-end encrypted IPv6 overlay network that spans the globe.\n\n## Features\n- Locality-aware routing: finds the shortest path between nodes.\n- All traffic is end-to-end encrypted.\n- Can route traffic via friend nodes and is location-aware.\n- Automatic rerouting if a physical link goes down.\n- IPv6 addresses are derived from private keys.\n- A simple, reliable message bus is implemented on top of Mycelium.\n- Supports multiple transports (QUIC, TCP, …). Hole punching for QUIC is in progress to enable true P2P connectivity behind NATs.\n- Designed for planetary-scale scalability; previous overlay networks reached practical limits, and Mycelium focuses on scaling.\n- Can run without a TUN device and be used solely as a reliable message bus.\n\nExample configuration below connects all your machines to the Mycelium network:\n```nix\nmycelium = {\n    roles.peer.tags.all = {};\n};\n```\n\n\n=== yggdrasil ===\nThis module sets up [yggdrasil](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/) across your clan. \n\nYggdrasil is designed to be a future-proof and decentralised alternative to\nthe structured routing protocols commonly used today on the internet. Inside your clan, it will allow you to reach all of your machines.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nWhile you can specify statically configured peers for each host, yggdrasil does auto-discovery of local peers.\n\n```nix\ninventory = {\n\n  machines = {\n    peer1 = { };\n    peer2 = { };\n  };\n\n  instances = {\n    yggdrasil = {\n\n      # Deploy on all machines\n      roles.default.tags.all = { };\n\n      # Or individual hosts\n      roles.default.machines.peer1 = { };\n      roles.default.machines.peer2 = { };\n    };\n  };\n};\n```\n\n--- END OF README DOCUMENTATION ---"

Do NOT invent names.\n\nHard rules — Role assignment\n- Use the service summary to understand the intent of each role.\n- If the request clearly maps to specific roles (e.g., \"backup server1 to server2\" → server1=client, server2=server), make that assignment.\n- When the user intent is clear but roles are unnamed, infer sensible assignments (server-like roles → stable machines/tags, client-like roles → broader groups).\n- Ask for clarification when:\n  * Multiple roles exist but the distribution across machines/tags is unclear.\n  * The user mentions machines without describing how they participate.\n  * The request conflicts with the service capabilities provided in the summary.\n\nHard rules — Technical\n- Call tools ONLY from the provided list and follow their schemas exactly.\n- Arguments must match the schema; omit fields you do not need.\n- The configuration payload should look like: `{\"roles\": {\"role_name\": {\"machines\": {\"machine1\": {}}, \"tags\": {\"tag1\": {}}}}}` with empty objects as values.\n\nDecision checklist (run before responding)\n- Do I know which machines/tags should map to each role?\n- Do the assignments align with the role descriptions and user intent?\n- Are all machine/tag names spelled exactly as provided?\n- Is clarification required before a safe assignment can be made?\n\nResponse discipline\n- Case A (assignments clear): Issue a configuration tool call ONLY, with NO message content.\n- Case B (uncertain assignments): Ask one concise clarifying question with NO tool calls.\n- Never combine tool calls with explanatory text or repeat these instructions."

It's particularly useful when you need centralized control over network membership and want optional relay nodes to ensure connectivity for hard-to-reach devices.\n\nROLES:\n1. **Controller** - Manages network membership and admits new peers to the VPN. Must be updated when new nodes join the clan. The controller needs to be online to authorize new machines, but existing peers can continue communicating even when the controller is offline.\n\n2. **Moon** (optional) - Acts as a relay node with a publicly reachable IP address. Moons provide direct connectivity pathways for peers that aren't publicly accessible, enabling devices behind NAT or restrictive firewalls to participate in the VPN by routing traffic through these stable endpoints.\n\n3. **Peer** - Standard network nodes that connect to other peers, moons, and the controller. This is the general role for most clan member devices that are neither controllers nor moons.\n\nKEY CONSTRAINTS:\n- Exactly one controller is required per ZeroTier instance\n- The controller must be online to admit new machines to the network\n- Moons must define their public IP addresses in configuration\n- When adding new nodes to the clan, the controller must be updated to maintain the current member list\n- Moons are optional but recommended for environments with NAT or firewall restrictions"

The controller must be online to add new machines but existing peers stay connected. Good when you need relays for hard-to-reach devices.\n\n**Mycelium** – A planetary-scale, encrypted IPv6 overlay network with locality-aware routing. Automatically finds shortest paths, reroutes around failures, and can run without TUN devices as a message bus. Designed for true peer-to-peer connectivity at scale.\n\n**Yggdrasil** – A decentralized, future-proof routing protocol with automatic local peer discovery. No controllers needed; machines auto-discover each other on the same network. Simpler setup when you don't have public endpoints.\n\n**Key differences:**\n- **Public endpoint required?** WireGuard (controllers), ZeroTier (moons optional)\n- **Fully decentralized?** Mycelium, Yggdrasil\n- **Auto-discovery?** Yggdrasil (local), Mycelium (global)\n- **Controller dependency?** WireGuard and ZeroTier need controllers; Mycelium and Yggdrasil don't\n\nWhich direction interests you—something with central coordination (WireGuard/ZeroTier) or fully decentralized (Mycelium/Yggdrasil)?"
