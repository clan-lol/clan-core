cProfile Output Columns Explanation:

- ncalls: The number of calls to the function. This includes both direct and indirect (recursive) calls.

- tottime: The total time spent in the given function alone, excluding time spent in calls to sub-functions.
  This measures the function's own overhead and execution time.

- percall (first instance): Represents the average time spent in the function per call, calculated as tottime divided by ncalls.
  This value excludes time spent in sub-function calls, focusing on the function's own processing time.

- cumtime: The cumulative time spent in this function and all the sub-functions it calls (both directly and indirectly).
  This includes all execution time within the function, from the start of its invocation to its return,
  including all calls to other functions and the time those calls take.

- percall (second instance): Represents the average time per call, including time spent in this function and in all sub-function calls.
  It is calculated as cumtime divided by ncalls, providing an average over all calls that includes all nested function calls.
