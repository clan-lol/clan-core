### Examples

`  $ clan ssh berlin`


  Will ssh in to the machine called `berlin`, using the
  `clan.core.networking.targetHost` specified in its configuration

`  $ clan ssh --json [JSON] --host-key-check none`

  Will ssh in to the machine based on the deployment information contained in
  the json string. [JSON] can either be a json formatted string itself, or point
  towards a file containing the deployment information
