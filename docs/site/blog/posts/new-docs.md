Last week, we added a new documentation hub for clan at [docs.clan.lol](https://docs.clan.lol).
We are still working on improving the installation procedures, so stay tuned.
We now have weekly office hours where people are invited to hangout and ask questions.
They are every Wednesday 15:30 UTC (17:30 CEST) in our [jitsi](https://jitsi.lassul.us/clan.lol).
Otherwise drop by in our [matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#clan:clan.lol).
