### Generate Facts and Vars

Typically, this step is handled automatically when a machine is deployed. However, to enable the use of `nix flake check` with your configuration, it must be completed manually beforehand.

Currently, generating all the necessary facts requires two separate commands. This is due to the coexistence of two parallel secret management solutions:
the newer, recommended version (`clan vars`) and the older version (`clan facts`) that we are slowly phasing out.

To generate both facts and vars, execute the following commands:

```sh
clan facts generate && clan vars generate
```


### Check Configuration

Validate your configuration by running:

```bash
nix flake check
```

This command helps ensure that your system configuration is correct and free from errors.

!!! Tip

    You can integrate this step into your [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) workflow to ensure that only valid Nix configurations are merged into your codebase.
