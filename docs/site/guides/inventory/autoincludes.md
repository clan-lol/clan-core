# Auto-included Files

Clan automatically imports specific files from each machine directory and registers them, reducing the need for manual configuration.

## Machine Registration

Every folder under `machines/{machineName}` is automatically registered as a Clan machine.

!!! info "Files loaded automatically for each machine"

The following files are detected and imported for every Clan machine:

- [x] `machines/{machineName}/configuration.nix`
  Main configuration file for the machine.

- [x] `machines/{machineName}/hardware-configuration.nix`
  Hardware-specific configuration generated by NixOS.

- [x] `machines/{machineName}/facter.json`
  Contains system facts. Automatically generated â€” see [nixos-facter](https://clan.lol/blog/nixos-facter/) for details.

- [x] `machines/{machineName}/disko.nix`
  Disk layout configuration. See the [disko quickstart](https://github.com/nix-community/disko/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md) for more info.

## Other Auto-included Files

* **`inventory.json`**
  Managed by Clan's API.
  Merges with `clan.inventory` to extend the inventory.

* **`.clan-flake`**
  Sentinel file to be used to locate the root of a Clan repository.
  Falls back to `.git`, `.hg`, `.svn`, or `flake.nix` if not found.
