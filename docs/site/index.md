# :material-home: What is Clan?

[Clan](https://clan.lol/) is a peer-to-peer computer management framework that
empowers you to **selfhost in a reliable and scalable way**.

Built on NixOS, Clan provides a **declarative interface for managing machines** with automated [secret management](./guides/secrets.md), easy [mesh VPN
connectivity](./guides/mesh-vpn.md), and [automated backups](./guides/backups.md).

Whether you're running a homelab or maintaining critical computing infrastructure,
Clan will help **reduce maintenance burden** by allowing a **git repository to define your whole network** of computers.

In combination with [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix), [nixos-anywhere](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-anywhere) and [disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko), Clan makes it possible to have **collaborative infrastructure**.

At the heart of Clan are [Clan Services](./reference/clanServices/index.md) - the core
concept that enables you to add functionality across multiple machines in your
network. While Clan ships with essential core services, you can [create custom
services](./guides/clanServices.md) tailored to your specific needs.
